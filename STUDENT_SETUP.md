# Student Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up your fork of the Terraform course repository and configure automated grading.

## Overview

In this course, you will:
1. Fork the main course repository to your own GitHub account
2. Complete labs in your fork's `week-XX/lab-YY/student-work/` directories
3. Create Pull Requests **within your own fork** to trigger automated grading
4. Deploy infrastructure to **your own AWS account**

## Initial Setup

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to https://github.com/shart-cloud/labs_terraform_course
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
3. Select your personal GitHub account as the destination
4. Wait for the fork to complete

You should now have: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/labs_terraform_course`

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/labs_terraform_course.git
cd labs_terraform_course
```

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions Secrets

The automated grading system needs access to your AWS account and Infracost. You must add these as **GitHub Secrets** in your fork.

**Choose your preferred method:**

#### Method A: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended - Fast & Secure)

The GitHub CLI provides the fastest and most secure way to set up secrets.

**Complete guide**: See [GITHUB_CLI_SETUP.md](GITHUB_CLI_SETUP.md)

**Quick version**:
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if not already installed)
brew install gh                    # macOS
sudo apt install gh               # Ubuntu/Debian
winget install GitHub.cli         # Windows

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Navigate to your fork
cd labs_terraform_course

# Run the automated setup script
./scripts/setup-secrets.sh

# Or set secrets manually
gh secret set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
gh secret set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
gh secret set INFRACOST_API_KEY

# Verify
gh secret list
```

#### Method B: Using GitHub Web Interface (Alternative)

##### 3.1 Get Your AWS Credentials

1. Log in to your AWS account
2. Create an IAM user for Terraform (if you haven't already):
   - Navigate to IAM → Users → Create User
   - Username: `terraform-student`
   - Attach policy: `AdministratorAccess` (for learning purposes)
   - Create access key for "Command Line Interface (CLI)"
   - **Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key**

##### 3.2 Get Your Infracost API Key

1. Register for a free Infracost account:
   ```bash
   infracost auth login
   ```
   
2. Get your API key:
   ```bash
   infracost configure get api_key
   ```

##### 3.3 Add Secrets via Web Interface

1. Go to your fork: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/labs_terraform_course`
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Add three secrets:
   - **Name**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`  
     **Value**: Your AWS access key ID
   - **Name**: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  
     **Value**: Your AWS secret access key
   - **Name**: `INFRACOST_API_KEY`  
     **Value**: Your Infracost API key

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Never commit these credentials to your code!

### Step 4: Configure AWS CLI Locally

For local development and testing:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter:
- AWS Access Key ID: (your access key)
- AWS Secret Access Key: (your secret key)
- Default region: `us-east-1`
- Default output format: `json`

Verify:
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## Working on Labs

### Lab Workflow

For each lab, follow this process:

#### 1. Create a Branch (Recommended)

```bash
git checkout -b week-00-lab-00
```

Or work directly on `main` if you prefer.

#### 2. Navigate to Lab Directory

```bash
cd week-00/lab-00/student-work
```

#### 3. Complete Your Work

Write your Terraform code following the lab instructions.

#### 4. Test Locally

```bash
# Format your code
terraform fmt

# Initialize
terraform init

# Validate
terraform validate

# Check cost estimate
infracost breakdown --path .

# Review the plan
terraform plan

# Deploy (to your AWS account)
terraform apply
```

#### 5. Commit and Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Week 0 Lab 0"
git push origin week-00-lab-00
```

(Or `git push origin main` if working on main branch)

#### 6. Create Pull Request **In Your Fork**

This is the key difference from typical workflows!

1. Go to **your fork** on GitHub: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/labs_terraform_course`
2. Click **Pull requests** → **New pull request**
3. **IMPORTANT**: Both base and compare should be in YOUR fork:
   - Base repository: `YOUR-USERNAME/labs_terraform_course` base: `main`
   - Head repository: `YOUR-USERNAME/labs_terraform_course` compare: `week-00-lab-00`
4. Title your PR: `Week 0 Lab 0 - Your Name`
5. Fill out the PR template
6. Click **Create pull request**

#### 7. Wait for Automated Grading

Within a few minutes, the GitHub Actions workflow will:
- ✅ Check code formatting
- ✅ Validate Terraform configuration
- ✅ Run lab-specific tests
- ✅ Generate cost estimates
- ✅ Perform security scanning
- ✅ Calculate your grade (0-100 points)
- ✅ Post results as a comment on your PR

#### 8. Review Your Grade

The grading bot will post a detailed comment showing:
- **Final Grade**: Points and letter grade
- **Breakdown by Category**:
  - Code Quality (25 points)
  - Functionality (30 points)
  - Cost Management (20 points)
  - Security (15 points)
  - Documentation (10 points)
- **Specific Issues**: What passed and what needs fixing

#### 9. Improve Your Grade (If Needed)

If you scored less than desired:

1. Review the feedback in the PR comment
2. Fix the issues in your code
3. Commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix formatting issues"
   git push origin week-00-lab-00
   ```
4. The grading workflow will automatically re-run
5. The bot will update its comment with your new grade

#### 10. Submit to Instructor

Once you're satisfied with your grade:

1. **Option A**: Tag your instructor in a PR comment:
   ```
   @shart-cloud Ready for final review! Grade: 95/100
   ```

2. **Option B**: Submit your PR link via your course LMS/form

3. **Option C**: Your instructor may have a list of student forks and will check them directly

#### 11. Clean Up Resources

After grading is complete:

```bash
cd week-00/lab-00/student-work
terraform destroy
```

Or wait for the auto-teardown action (8 hours).

**IMPORTANT**: Always clean up to avoid unexpected AWS charges!

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Not Running

**Problem**: PR created but no grading workflow runs.

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you have GitHub Actions enabled in your fork (Settings → Actions)
- Check that your PR modifies files in `week-*/lab-*/student-work/`
- Verify the workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/grading.yml`

### AWS Authentication Errors in Actions

**Problem**: Workflow fails with AWS authentication errors.

**Solutions**:
- Verify you added `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as repository secrets
- Check secret names are exact (case-sensitive)
- Ensure your IAM user has proper permissions
- Test credentials locally: `aws sts get-caller-identity`

### Infracost Errors

**Problem**: Cost estimation fails.

**Solutions**:
- Verify you added `INFRACOST_API_KEY` as a repository secret
- Test locally: `infracost configure get api_key`
- Re-authenticate: `infracost auth login`

### Terraform Plan Fails

**Problem**: `terraform plan` fails in the workflow.

**Solutions**:
- Test locally first: `terraform init && terraform plan`
- Check for syntax errors: `terraform validate`
- Ensure all required variables are defined
- Review the workflow logs for specific errors

### Wrong PR Base

**Problem**: Created PR against the original repository instead of your fork.

**Solution**:
- Close the incorrect PR
- Create a new PR with base = your fork's main branch
- Make sure both "base" and "compare" dropdowns show your username

### Grading Comment Not Posted

**Problem**: Workflow runs but no comment appears.

**Solutions**:
- Check workflow logs for errors
- Ensure your fork has Issues enabled (Settings → General → Features → Issues)
- Verify the workflow has `pull-requests: write` permission

## Tips for Success

### Before Submitting
- ✅ Run `terraform fmt` on all files
- ✅ Run `terraform validate` to check for errors
- ✅ Test `terraform plan` locally
- ✅ Run `infracost breakdown` to check costs
- ✅ Review your code for hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Ensure all required tags are present
- ✅ Add comments to explain your code
- ✅ Test deployment in your AWS account

### Cost Management
